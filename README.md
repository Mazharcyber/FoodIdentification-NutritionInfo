# FoodIdentification-NutritionInfo
 This project aims at detecting food from images and offering nutritional value data about these foods using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. Using Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face, and Gradio it demonstrates how deep learning can be used for food classification and nutrition extraction from images.
